## About

**Musical Lamp** is a unique project that allows you to control both the light and music simultaneously for an immersive, interactive experience. Whether it's flashing to the beat of the music, dimming during quiet moments, or creating colorful, soothing light patterns to accompany relaxing melodies, the **Musical Lamp** makes any environment feel alive.

The project uses real-time audio analysis to adjust light patterns based on the rhythm and intensity of the music. You can even customize how your lamp responds to different genres of music, moods, or personal preferences.

## Features

- **Music-Responsive Lighting:** Adjust the color and brightness of your lamp based on the music’s tempo, beats, and rhythm.
- **Color Customization:** Choose from a wide range of colors, or let the lamp automatically select the perfect hues based on the genre or mood.
- **Dynamic Light Patterns:** Create dynamic light patterns such as pulsing, flashing, or smooth transitions to match the music's energy.
- **Sound Visualization:** Visualize the sound by displaying animated light effects based on the frequency and intensity of different audio ranges (bass, mid, treble).
- **Integration with Music Apps:** Connect seamlessly to music streaming apps like Spotify, Apple Music, or even local music files.
- **Easy Control Interface:** Control the lamp via a simple app or web interface to customize settings, set up playlists, and adjust light behavior.
